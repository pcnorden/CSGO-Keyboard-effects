# CSGO Keyboard Effects

This is a software to display ammunition and health on the keyboard from the popular game "Counter-Strike : Global Offensive".

This software is currently marked as "BETA" because of only half-supporting corsair RGB keyboards, as I still have a lot to learn when it comes to the wrapper that DarthAffe made([link to wrapper](https://github.com/DarthAffe/CUE.NET)), and how to make plugins.

#How do I set it up?

This is actually one of the easier things:

1. Open steam
2. Select CS:GO, and rightclick on the game
3. Select `properties`
4. On the tabs, select `Local Files`
5. Press `Browse local files`
6. Go into the folder marked `csgo`, then `cfg`
7. Get the file called `gamestate_integration_csgokeyboardpcnorden.cfg` from the zip file, and place it in the `cfg` folder.

And you're done!

#How do I run it?

You need to have the .exe file in the same place as the `x64` and `x86` folders.

The program will create a default template xml file if it doesn't exists and fill it with values.

With the xml generated, you can edit what buttons light up for diffrent weapon slots.

#How could I help with this project?

Well, the very best thing you could do is support me with some money, as I currently go in school, and I can't afford keyboards to develop on.

Othervise it could be great if you reported the errors you get when running the program.
